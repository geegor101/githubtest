This is our submission for GMTK 2023's game jam!! The theme was REVERSED ROLES
The approach we took was creating a reversed dating simulator where instead of trying to get with someone... you break up with them!! For all of us, this was the very first game we've ever developed. We thought a visual novel would be a perfect starter game project since it also how most dating simulators are played as. 

## How to play
There's 2 different girlfriends you can go against:
1. Perfect girlfriend
2. Toxic girlfriend
You have 16 different combos you can try to use based on what your ACTIONS and WORDS are. However, trying to use the same combos might not get you the same result... so spamming isn't everything! Just say and do the right things in given situations to make her want to break up with you ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
